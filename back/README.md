# INBENTA

The first things we have to do, once we have downloaded from GIT the proyect are:

1. Clone the proyect from GIT -> [Inbenta](https://github.com/scrafy/Inbenta.git)

2. Go inside of back folder

3. Edit the Conf.php class and set the value of this variable ->  `private $client_address = "http://inbenta.surge.sh";`. For example if you are launching yor front from your local (http://localhost:3000), you would have to set it to that value

4. Deploy all files in some PHP Server (Apache for example)
