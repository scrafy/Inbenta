The first things we have to do, once we have downloaded from GIT the proyect are:

1. Clone the proyect from GIT -> [Inbenta](https://github.com/scrafy/Inbenta.git)

2. Go inside of front folder

3. Install node modules executing the following command from this directory -> `npm i`

4. Set the endpoint API where you have deployed the PHP backend. For it, edit the .env file and set the value of this environment variable: `REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT`
